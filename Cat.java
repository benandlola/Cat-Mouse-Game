/*A cat eats a mouse if they end up on the same location. That is, the mouse should die and be removed from the simulation.
If a cat doesnâ€™t eat a mouse within 50 moves, the cat dies.
Cats jump two spaces at a time. They do not traverse the grid point they jump over. That is, if they are on space (1,2) they would move to (1,4).
Cats randomly turn, change direction, 5% of the time.
Cats are displayed as a yellow dot.
If Cat does not eat within 50 rounds, they instead turn into a Zombie Cat.*/
